            <p>I am doing this as my BTP (Btech project) under Dr. Krishnamurthy Dinesh.</p>
            <p>We have two problems, A and B, and we attempt to improve the algorithm for A. What fine-grained reduction states is that improving the algorithm for problem B could lead to an improvement in the  algorithm for problem A. we focussed on problems like 3-SUM, Orthogonal Vectors,NFA acceptance
